/*
  - bonus create a route that uses this component in App.js
  - this component should send a fetch request to http://localhost:3001/pets/id
  - think about how we get the id from the props of our router to pass into the above route
  - should contain state for pet since that's a value that will change before and after we load our pet, so null if the pet isn't loaded, display pet information if it is
  - use a ternary, if pet is null display loading... otherwise display pet information
  - use the petIndex as a guide of that ternary
